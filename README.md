# spring-rest-service-sample
This is a good sample of spring rest service skeleton integrated with hibernate, with junit testing.

DB setting:
Run sample.sql and sample_test_schemal.sql
Note: As the application is integrated with mysql, so it is mandatory to setup mysql DB to make the application/unit testing working.
